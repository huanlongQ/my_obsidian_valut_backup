# Irreps (Irreduciable Representation)

[with gemini](https://g.co/gemini/share/41e728572fe4) 
irreps $D(g)$ are the representation of group element $g$. 
## SO(3) group and its irreps for atomic orbital quantum states

$l=l$ irreps of SO(3): $D^{(l)}(\mathbf{R})$. $\mathbf{R}$ is 3D rotation group element in SO(3). 
$D^{(l)}(\mathbf{R})$ is a $(2l+1)\times(2l+1)$ shaped matrix(Wigner $D$ matrix for atomic orbital quantum states)

then, the $l=l$ quantum state vector and tensor are obj transformed as irreps of SO(3) $D^{(l)}(\mathbf{R})$ between 2 specific basis.
