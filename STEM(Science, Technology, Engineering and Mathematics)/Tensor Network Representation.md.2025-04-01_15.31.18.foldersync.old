The key feature of Tensor Network Representation is to ***reduce the complexity of quantum problem***  $O(e^{ \text{Scale} }) \to O(\text{Poly}(\text{Scale}))$ . 
* Examples: **Matrix Product State, Tree TN, projected entangled pair state**

# 1. Matrix Product State (MPS)
Thank MPS, I have learnt the trick of **tensor diagram**. 
## 2.1 Theory of MPS
The normal form of a quantum state: 
$$
∣\Psi⟩=\sum_{i_1​,i_2​,…,i_N}​​C_{i_1​,i_2​,…,i_N}​​​∣i_1​⟩∣i_2​⟩⋯∣i_N​⟩
$$
while the MPS is: 
$$
∣\Psi⟩=\sum_{i1​,i2​,…,iN}A^{[1]}_{i_1} ​A^{[2]}_{i_{2}}​ \dots|i_{1},i_{2},i_{3}\dots\rangle
$$
$A^{[k]}_{i_{k}}$ is a group of  $D_{k-1}\times D_{k}$  matrix, $D_{k}$ is bond dimension. Bond dimension controls the amount of entanglement MPS can capture. 
The translation from MPS to normal quantum states is just contraction law of tensor: 
$$
C_{i_{1}i_{2}i_{3}\dots} = \Pi_{i_{1}i_{2}i_{3}\dots} A^{[1]}_{i_{1}}A^{[2]}_{i_{2}}\dots
$$
**Efficiency:**
The efficiency of MPS, from exp complexity to poly, owe to **sparsity*** nature of quantum states, AKA **Area Law**.
The scale of Hilbert space is reduced from $O(d^{N})$ to $O(NdD^{2})$ Where $d$ is the **local dimension** of a lattice state. 
- physical meaning of bond dimensions
	if bond dim is 0, then there would be no entanglement at all. the more bond dim we have, the more entanglement we get.

	gapped ＝ localization ＝ area law
	gapless ＝ thermalization ＝ volumn law

This method is genius, totally genius. It shows an art of alignment. 


## 2.3 Orthogonalization and Canonical Forms of MPS
Normally, we use singular value decomposition (**SVD**) or QR decomposition to orthogonalize a MPS. If we add a truncation process, this means **depressing storage**. 
![[Pasted image 20250329171011.png]]**Canonical Form:**
MPS is a non-unique representation of quantum states. Thus we need canonical forms to confirm a certain state. 
orthogonalization method like SVD and QR is used to establish a canonical form from a casual arranged(or any) MPS. o

## 2.4 DMRG Density Matrix Renormalization Group

DMRG is worked only for ground state calculation primarily. It's also a iterative convergence algorithm. 
DMRG sweep the MPS iteratively, choosing ground state in every blocked local tensor states. Effective Hamiltonian is constructed from MPO(Matrix Product Operator) representation of the overall Hamiltonian. 

## 2.5 MPO in DMRG (Matrix Product Operator)
MPO is constructed by a **finite states automaton(有限状态机)** normally.

**DMRG** $H_{\text{eff}}:$ As you should know, if a state is the ground state of a quantum system, this $H_{\text{eff}}$ would be just a identify mapping for the 2-site MPS.
