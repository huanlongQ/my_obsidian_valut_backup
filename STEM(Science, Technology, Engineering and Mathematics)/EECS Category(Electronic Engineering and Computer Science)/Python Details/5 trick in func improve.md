# 1. Meaningful name helps
`vowels_count() is better than vowels()`

# 2. Type Annoation
```
def vowels_count(
txt:str,
)->int:
```
# 3. Add string desc
```
def vowels_count(
txt:str,
)->int:
"""
This func count vowels 'aeiou', 'AEIOU' number. 

:param
:return

"""
```
# 3. write in a readiable way
more lines of code benefit.
