> Okay, let's look at the standard files and structures you typically find in a well-organized Python package. When you create a Python package that you intend to share or distribute, there are certain conventions and essential files.
> 
> Here are some of the key standard files and objects you'll commonly find in a Python package:
> 
> 1. **The Package Directory:** This is the main folder that holds your package's code. Its name is the name you'll use when you `import` the package. For example, in the DeepH-pack repository, the `deeph` folder is the main package directory.
>     
> 2. **`__init__.py` file:** This is a crucial file that resides inside the package directory. Its presence tells Python that the directory should be considered a Python package. It can be empty, or it can contain initialization code for the package, define what gets imported when you use `from package_name import *`, or set up package-level variables.
>     
> 3. **Module files (`.py`):** These are the individual Python files within your package directory and its subdirectories. Each `.py` file represents a module. For example, `deeph/preprocess/abacus_get_data.py` is a module within the `preprocess` submodule of the `deeph` package.
>     
> 4. **`setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`:** These files are essential for defining how your package is built and installed.
>     
>     - **`setup.py`**: The traditional way to define package metadata (name, version, author, description, dependencies) and entry points using the `setuptools` library.
>     - **`pyproject.toml`**: The newer standard for defining build system requirements and package metadata, specified by PEP 518 and PEP 621. Many modern Python projects are moving towards using `pyproject.toml`.
> 5. **`requirements.txt` (Common Convention):** As we discussed, this file lists the external Python packages that your package depends on. While not a strict part of the core packaging specifications, it's a widely adopted convention for making it easy for users and developers to install the necessary dependencies.
>     
> 6. **`README` file (e.g., `README.md`, `README.rst`):** This file provides a description of the package, its purpose, how to install it, how to use it, and often examples. It's the first thing many people look at when encountering a new package.
>     
> 7. **`LICENSE` file:** This file contains the terms under which your package is distributed. It's important to include a license so users know how they can legally use, modify, and distribute your code.
>     
> 8. **Tests Directory/Files (e.g., `tests/`):** It's standard practice to include tests for your code to ensure it works correctly and to prevent regressions when changes are made. These are often organized in a `tests` directory.  
>     **测试目录/文件（例如 `tests/` ）：** 在代码中添加测试是标准做法，以确保代码正常运行，并防止代码更改后出现回归问题。这些测试通常组织在 `tests` 目录中。
>     
> 9. **Documentation Directory (e.g., `docs/`):** As seen in DeepH-pack, a `docs` directory is common for storing the source files for your project's documentation.
>     
> 10. **Data Files (Optional):** If your package needs to include non-code files (like data files, configuration templates, etc.), they are typically included as package data.
>     
> 
> These files and structures help make a Python package discoverable, installable, maintainable, and understandable to others. The specific set of files might vary slightly depending on the project's complexity and the tools used for packaging and documentation.
