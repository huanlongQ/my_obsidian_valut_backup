## **Pre-reading:**

- Relevance: what for
- Time: how much
- Focus: what's the structure like
- Reaction: emotion

## **Warm-up**

- Pause and reset the eye
- Concentrate
- Stretch the eye (change your focal length)
- Thenpush yourself

## **Consistent reading habits**

### Use your time effectively:

Review and recall regularly; separate your reading and criticizing process:

1. [Skim](https://zhida.zhihu.com/search?content_id=53951207&content_type=Answer&match_order=1&q=Skim&zhida_source=entity)- pre-read read (looking for ideas, avoid reading detail; should be looking at section headings or the first sentence of each paragraph) and leave time for
2. [Scan](https://zhida.zhihu.com/search?content_id=53951207&content_type=Answer&match_order=1&q=Scan&zhida_source=entity)- critic, and comprehension (quickly looking through material that you are already familiar with, looking for key information or ideas)

### [Consistent labeling system](https://zhida.zhihu.com/search?content_id=53951207&content_type=Answer&match_order=1&q=Consistent+labeling+system&zhida_source=entity): label your documents properly

### [Consistent note-taking system](https://zhida.zhihu.com/search?content_id=53951207&content_type=Answer&match_order=1&q=Consistent+note-taking+system&zhida_source=entity)

## **Learn to use your eyes: sharking and chunking**

1. Reduce your eye fixation time (the time spent when your eyes are focused on a single point)
2. Expand your eye fixation zone (the ability to see a wider frame when your eyes are focused on a single point)
3. Increase your re-fixation speed (the ability to reposition your eyes at a rapid rate)

### _Exercise:_

Have a go at reading two words at a time; add two extra

Have a go at reading three words at a time; add three extra

Practice for a short time and then redo the one-minute read

## **Bad habits and solutions**

### Bad habit 1: Re-reading and regression

**Solution:** Sharking it, keep pushing forward nonstop

### Bad habit 2: Sub-vocalization (pronouncing the words in your mind while reading)

**Solution:** say a short word repeatedly and continuously when you are reading.

## **Other tips:**

1. Guides and pacing: your eyes need something to follow  
    
2. From sweeping to hopping: chunking  
    
3. Establishing the power of your peripheral vision: lazy Z

## **Summary: a combined strategy for academically effective rapid reading**

1. Ask yourself: what do I know about this already? What's my purpose here?
2. Pre-read read (skim): a quick glance at the flavor, the mental framework of the whole text, ideas, style, structure, figures
3. The real read (scan): read for meaning, keywords/passages, and phrases
4. The review read: 3rd time around, review meaning, etc.
5. Repeat
6. After each stage, you should ask yourself: SO WHAT
7. Last but not least, keep a consistent reading habit
