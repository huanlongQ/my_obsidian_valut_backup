![[Pasted image 20250507115328.png]]
**Dispersion Relation:**  
$$
E(\vec{k}) \approx \hbar v_{D}|\vec{k}-\vec{k_{D}}|
$$
 with $v_{D}$ is Dirac velosity. 
 This *dispersion* relation shows a **massless** relattivistic fermion form. 
 - $\frac{\partial^{2} E}{\partial k^{2}} = 0$, this means 0 effective mass. thus it can reach extremely high carrier mobilities
 - some pesudo-relativistic effect. 
**Density of States(DoS):** 
from the dispersion relation, we conclude:
$$
D(E) \propto |E|^{d-1}
$$
DoS vanishes linearly at dirac point. this could form a pesudo gap. AKA pesudo banned gap region. Then we can prove the validation of **Dirac Semiconductor**.
