- [[Ground Truth and Conceptions in Condensed Matter Theory]] this should be its topic. 
- [[Hubbard Model]] this is also Hubbard Model topic. 
### **High-Temperature Superconductivity and Related Models**

- **t-t'-J Model:** This is a fundamental theoretical model used to describe the behavior of electrons in certain materials, **particularly high-temperature superconductors like cuprates**. It is an extension of the t-J model, which itself is derived from the Hubbard model. The model considers the "hopping" of electrons between nearest-neighbor (t) and next-nearest-neighbor (t') sites on a crystal lattice, as well as the magnetic superexchange interaction (J) between adjacent electron spins.
$$
H = -\sum_{ij\sigma} t_{ij}(c^{\dagger}_{i\sigma}c_{j\sigma}+h.c.)+\sum_{ij}J_{ij}\left( S_{i}\cdot S_{j}-\frac{1}{4}(n_{i\uparrow}+n_{i\downarrow})(n_{j\uparrow}+n_{j\downarrow}) \right)
$$
where $S_{i}\cdot S_{j}=S_{i,x}\cdot S_{j,x}+S_{i,y}\cdot S_{j,y}+S_{i,z}\cdot S_{j,z}$. 
- the first term:
	kinetic energy of electron themselvesa and electron-lattice interaction. 
- The Second Terms:
	$S_{i}\cdot S_{j}$ for exchange interaction and $-\frac{1}{4}n_{i}n_{j} = \dots$   ensures that the **magnetic interaction only applies** when both sites _i_ and _j_ are occupied by electrons
	

- **d-Wave Superconductivity:** In contrast to the **isotropic s-wave pairing in conventional superconductors**, **d-wave superconductivity features an anisotropic pairing symmetry**. The superconducting energy gap in d-wave superconductors is not uniform in all directions and has nodes, or points where the gap vanishes. The paper investigates the robust d-wave superconducting order in the t-t'-J model.
    
- **Hubbard Model:** A foundational model in condensed matter physics that describes interacting electrons on a lattice. It is considered a key to understanding electron correlation, which is essential for phenomena like high-temperature superconductivity. The t-J model is a strong-coupling limit of the Hubbard model.
    

### **Exotic Phases and Phenomena**

- **Pseudogap (PG) Regime:** An enigmatic phase of matter observed in the normal state (above the superconducting transition temperature) of many high-temperature superconductors. It is characterized by a suppression of the density of electronic states at the Fermi level, which is a precursor to the full energy gap that opens in the superconducting state. The paper identifies a pseudogap regime in the phase diagram of the t-t'-J model, marked by suppressed magnetic susceptibility.
    
- **Charge Density Wave (CDW):** A state of matter where the electron density forms a periodic modulation, creating a superstructure on top of the underlying crystal lattice. The paper discusses the presence of CDW instabilities, particularly for the hole-doped (tâ€²/t<0) case of the model.
    
- **Stripe Order:** A competing ground state in some strongly correlated electron systems where the doped holes and spins arrange themselves into one-dimensional stripes. This can suppress superconductivity. The paper notes that the inclusion of next-nearest-neighbor hopping (t') in the model suppresses this stripe order, allowing d-wave superconductivity to emerge.
    
- **Luther-Emery Liquid:** A theoretical description of a one-dimensional system of interacting electrons that has a gap in its spin excitations but gapless charge excitations. The paper mentions that on long cyclinders, the superconducting state takes the form of a Luther-Emery liquid.
