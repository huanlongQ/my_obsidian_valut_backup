- this topic is related to [[Extremely High Dimensionality]]. I have to say that the High Dimensionality has been the golden rule of a good neural network. 

$$
\mathcal{O}(2^{Q}) \to \mathcal O (MQ)
$$

the disad of low dimensionality property of compression leads to the need for stablization method.
