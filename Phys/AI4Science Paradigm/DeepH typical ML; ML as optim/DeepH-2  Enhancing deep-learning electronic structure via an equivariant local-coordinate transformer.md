## 1. Wigner-Eckart thm: 
$$
l_{1}\otimes l_{2} = \oplus_{l=|l_{1}-l_{2}|}^{l_{1}+l_{2}}|l|
$$
where $\otimes$ means tensor product like $|l_{1}m_{1}\rangle\otimes|l_{2}m_{2}\rangle$ while $\oplus$ means concatration of tensor(or simple addition of different $l$ tensors like $\sum_{l=|l_{1}-l_{2}|,m}^{l_{1}+l_{2}} |l,m\rangle$) 



## 2. Comparision with DeepH-E3
- ***DeepH-2'SU(2) symmetric local coordinates just solved the problem of DeepH-1's discontinunity and DeepH-2's nonlocal coordinates problem(which is not efficiency).***

in the contrast to DeepH-E3 with SO(3) covariance in the global coordinate level, DeepH-2 leverage the property of local coordinate with $z$ axis aligned with particular edge, leading to a SO(2) covariance for rotation with respect to the local coordinate $z$ axis. 
therefore, the rotation and counter-rotation to dive into and go out from a particular local coordinate is crucially needed.
