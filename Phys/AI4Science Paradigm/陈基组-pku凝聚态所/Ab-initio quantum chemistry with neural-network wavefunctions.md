- [[Extremely High Dimensionality]] the charm of high dimensionality. 


ML method is much more expressive cuz it can give a tunable basis. ????? what about **FermNet**? **PauliNet** has a tunable basis while **FermNet** may not. 
**traditional variational method:**
$$
|\psi \rangle = \sum c_{i}|e_{i}\rangle
$$
where $c_i$ is **tunable**. 
**ML variational method:**
$$
|\psi\rangle_{\theta} = \sum c_{i,\theta}|e_{i,\theta}\rangle
$$
where $c_{i,\theta}, |e_{i,\theta}\rangle$ are **both tunable**.
