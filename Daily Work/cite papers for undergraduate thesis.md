pages={583-589},
abstract={Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1--4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence---the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8---has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10--14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

abstract={Hybrid density functional calculations are essential for accurate description of electronic structure, yet their widespread use is restricted by the substantial computational cost. Here we develop DeepH-hybrid, a deep equivariant neural network method for learning the hybrid-functional Hamiltonian as a function of material structure, which circumvents the time-consuming self-consistent field iterations and enables the study of large-scale materials with hybrid-functional accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate good reliability as well as effective transferability and efficiency of the method. As a notable application, DeepH-hybrid is applied to study large-supercell Moir{\'e}-twisted materials, offering the first case study on how the inclusion of exact exchange affects flat bands in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. The work generalizes deep-learning electronic structure methods to beyond conventional density functional theory, facilitating the development of deep-learning-based ab initio methods.},

    abstract = {Critical phenomena occur very close to a second-order phase transition. For example, a ferromagnet near its Curie point behaves quite similarly to a liquid near its critical point, and a superconducting transition is not very different from a second-order ferroelectric one. The simplest view of phenomena near a critical point, attributable in its general form to Landau, is of a universal character and therefore attributes certain common characteristics to all phase transitions. Although the Landau theory does not agree quantitatively with general experimental observations very close to a critical point, it provides much qualitative insight and also points to the origin of the breakdown of the simple theory as the critical point is approached. This chapter explores the Landau theory of critical phenomena and other modern theories of critical phenomena, experimental observation of static critical phenomena in ferroelectrics and antiferrodistortive transitions, dynamic scaling and soft modes, experimental observation of critical dynamics, displacement transitions, and order-disorder transitions.},

abstract={The Migdal-Kadanoff scheme is applied to the Ising model with a free surface. The resulting renormalization group transformation and the duality transformation commute in any dimension. Two simple recursion relations are obtained which reproduce the global phase diagram for the semi-infinite Ising model. The surface critical exponents space methods. In dimensiond=2+$\epsilon${\textasciiacutex}, we find the exponentsyt1(SB)=$\epsilon${\textasciiacutex} andyh1(SB)=1+$\epsilon${\textasciiacutex} for the multicritical surface-bulk transition. We also derive and discuss approximate differential recursion relations for the bulk and the surface free energies.},

abstract = {Interactions between fluctuating degrees of freedom can lead to cooperative phenomena that result in phase transitions and critical phenomena. The van der Waals mean field theory gives a qualitative description of the liquid-gas phase transition and critical point. The Ising model is a simple interacting model of magnetic phase transitions, binary alloys, and lattice gases. Approximate mean field theories of the Ising model give good qualitative descriptions of phase transitions and critical points. Critical behavior is described by a set of critical exponents, with scaling theory giving relations between these exponents. The exponent scaling relations obey exact exponent inequalities that follow from thermodynamics. Critical behavior is driven by the development of infinite-range correlations between fluctuating variables.}

abstract={Single-cell transcriptomics yields ever growing data sets containing RNA expression levels for thousands of genes from up to millions of cells. Common data analysis pipelines include a dimensionality reduction step for visualising the data in two dimensions, most frequently performed using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE). It excels at revealing local structure in high-dimensional data, but naive applications often suffer from severe shortcomings, e.g. the global structure of the data is not represented accurately. Here we describe how to circumvent such pitfalls, and develop a protocol for creating more faithful t-SNE visualisations. It includes PCA initialisation, a high learning rate, and multi-scale similarity kernels; for very large data sets, we additionally use exaggeration and downsampling-based initialisation. We use published single-cell RNA-seq data sets to demonstrate that this protocol yields superior results compared to the naive application of t-SNE.},
