**For me, the IdeaList is a list of ideas to implement while the Paper Reading notes monthly is just a note of paper.** 
# 1. TN + phase identification in quantum system + DGB's RG reweight. 

* [Tensor networks for interpretable and efficient quantum-inspired machine learning](https://spj.science.org/doi/10.34133/icomputing.0061)
* [Visualizing quantum phases and identifying quantum phase transitions by nonlinear dimensionality reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08461)
* [Adding machine learning within hamiltonians: Renormalization group transformations, symmetry breaking and restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08461)
Yes, this is a potential topic. I should spend some time on it. 
# 2. Renormalization Group + NN to fixed the size problem 
- [RG-Inspired Neural Networks for Computing Topological Invariants](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.105.205139)
- [Neural Monte Carlo renormalization group](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.023230)
	it used mutual info as loss function. mutual info is interesting.

# 3. Transformer + global property/CNN + localized property
