# 1. Reading Page 110~118
1. If you lived in the United States would you more likely be a Republican or a Democrat.  Give reasons why.
	I would like to be a Republican. I love Theodore Rosevelt(TR, GOP), uncle of Franklin Roosevelt(DEM). To my opinion, TR is the a real man that can do good official works and fight in a war with enemy for its state. His personal charm deeply attracts me. And in political area, through his term of office, power of fedural government and the United States is much more unified. To my knowledge, GOP always tend to expand fedural power, which gives president more oppotunity to advance agendas. For a pure China-brain man, that means higher efficiency and more benefits to common people. 
	Well, this reason seems not reasonable and not related to the context page 110 to 118. But it's my real reason of my question. 
2. In many States, possession of and smoking marijuana is legal. However, the federal law makes such actions illegal.  Why don’t federal law enforcement officers arrest marijuana users in states that allow marijuana smoking?
	In principle, The United States of America is a union of 50 different states(to my understand). The federal govenment is just a general agency of these states. Thus, as their commitment, the federal government can only manage interstate affairs and many other affairs with some limitations(like only on the highway or others). Possession of and smoking marijuana is allowed by some states. Thus if this happens outside the limitations of federal government's law, federal government should do nothing. 
	By the way, Eisenhover, the man who advanced the agenda of highway construction, is also a real man to my criterion. 

3. In some elections, voters cross party lines and vote for a presidential candidate that is not a member of their party.  No matter what party you would choose to be a member of, would you have voted for Mr. Trump or Ms. Harris in the 2024 election.  Why would you make that choice?
	I vote for Trump definitely. My reason for Trump is that I am a MAGA!(This is a joke) The real reason is that I followed almost all the process of election compaign of Trump and Harris and I found that Harris might dive into a mental collapse in the end. Although I am also a man without strong heart, that's a necessity for a president, especially president of the only superpower of the human being. Maybe Trump is not good enough(such many farces have occured), but I think Harris would be even worse. 

4. A very big issue in the 2024 elections, both federal and state, was the right to have an abortion.It is often argued that women have the right to do with their body whatever they want and that the government should not tell them what they can or cannot do.  Others argue that the babies  have rights as human beings, as well, it is just that they cannot talk and someone older must assert their right to live. Which branch of the federal government do you think should make the final  decision on this issue:  the women’s right to have an abortion versus the baby’s right to live. Explain.
	For myself, definitely the women's right to have an abortion. People have human rights, we all admit, but we are never glad to admit that someone has more human rights than others. The women and the babies both have human rights, but women has more and large human right than the babies. If we do not respect women's right to have an abortion, we are creating definite tragedies that can harm the current society while abortion just harms babies' right, who can not feel the pain(I hope) and give less harm to the current society. This is my criterion to measure the amount of human rights. 
	For America, I propose the public power to quit from this social debate and adopt the strategy of "Let It Go"(This is also a famous Taoist political quote by the way.) People or the society, as a collective natrual system(like economic market), would weight the advantages and disadvantages of both policy trends. After maybe ten or even twenty years of painful exploring, a strategy that all people can accept may appear. At this time, the fedural should appear, grasping the oppotunity to advance an agenda along people's collective will. To my knowledge, this is a traditional strategy of China government actually, from ancient empire to now socialist society with Chinese characteristics under Communist Party of China's leading. And this strategy do make sense and can work well mostly. Well, I know my proposal is childish and may lead to even a second Civil War to America......emmmm, you know I am just a political science amateur. I cannot make a full nice deliberate policy. And I am not American, so maybe a little(very) irresponsible.(!) Anyway, this is my answer. 

5. Do you think people should vote directly for the President of the United States rather than vote for electors?  Yes or no?  Why?
	No. People are foolish in political area I'm sure. I majors in physics and have learnt a lot of mathematics till now. However I can not even understand and apply things mathematicians are doing. Actually, I have also read many books about history, maybe even more than a PKU undergraduate majored in history. However, when I scrutiny policy decisions of my state China, I often regard a policy as a foolish one but it turn out to work greatly well. I seems to be able to understand the policy decisions, the words on official files seem understandable, but the truth is I do not know them at all! So, If let me, a undergraduate of PKU, as Prof Litwin say, the most clever students in China, vote for the president of China, I may just choose a fool that seems able to make reasonable decisions. Thus, I would like to vote for a lower level candidate, like a elector, or a member of a low level party organization of my Communist Party of China. For America, I think the answer is same cuz people are the same at political field. 

# 2. 10 class past tense
Trump and Harris **were** candidates of the 47th president of America. As a constrast, Trump **began** his election campaign much earlier than Harris cuz Joe Biden **left** her the candidate position only after his failed debate with Trump. The Trump supporters **said** that this **made** sure Trump's victory and the reality **did** show a great victory in all 7 swing states.

First, The White House. 
In China, I can visit the forbidden city which is ancient emperor's palace. This makes me maybe addicted to the office location of the highest leader of a country. 

Second, Mount Rushmore.
I Want To See Theodore Rosevelt! Teddy is the most manly man. I would like to say hello to his statue. 

Yellowstone National Park. 
It prevails that if the Yellowstone erupt, the whole world would be destroyed. This makes a curious boy excited if can observe it personally.
